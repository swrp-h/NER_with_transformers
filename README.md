# NER_with_transformers

This repository contains code for training and evaluating Named Entity Recognition (NER) models on the MultiNERD dataset for English. Two systems, A and B, are developed and compared. System A is fine-tuned on the English subset of the original dataset, while System B is further fine-tuned on a filtered dataset containing only five entity types (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, DISEASES, ANIMAL) and the O tag.
